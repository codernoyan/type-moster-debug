                            <p>LocalStorage and SessionStorage are almost the same. But there has major differences.</p>
                            <p><em><strong>LocalStorage</strong> persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.</em></p>
                            <p><em><strong>SessionStorage</strong> is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and new storage.</em></p>
